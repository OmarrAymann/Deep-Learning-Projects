# üñºÔ∏è CIFAR-10 Image Classification with CNN

## üìÑ Overview / Abstract

This project demonstrates the development and training of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to perform image classification on the CIFAR-10 dataset. CIFAR-10 is a widely-used benchmark that consists of 60,000 color images categorized into 10 classes. The notebook details the process of data preprocessing, model design, training, and evaluating the network's performance on unseen test data.

## üìä Dataset Description

The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of:

- **Total Images**: 60,000 color images (32x32 pixels)
- **Training Images**: 50,000
- **Test Images**: 10,000
- **Classes**: 10 distinct categories such as airplanes, automobiles, birds, cats, deer, dogs, frogs, horses, ships, and trucks.
- **Image Format**: RGB (3 channels)

The dataset is typically loaded from popular deep learning libraries such as TensorFlow or Keras.

## üß± Model Architecture

The CNN model in this project is structured to extract and learn features from the images through multiple layers. The architecture generally includes:

- **Input Layer**: Accepts images of size 32x32 with 3 color channels.
- **Convolutional Layers**: Several layers applying filters to capture spatial hierarchies in the images.
- **Activation Functions**: ReLU activations used to introduce non-linearity.
- **Pooling Layers**: MaxPooling layers to reduce spatial dimensions and retain key features.
- **Dropout Layers**: (Optional) For regularization and to prevent overfitting.
- **Fully Connected Layers**: Dense layers that process the flattened output from previous layers.
- **Output Layer**: A softmax layer with 10 units corresponding to the 10 image classes.

## üèãÔ∏è Training Details

- **Optimizer**: Typically Adam or SGD is used.
- **Loss Function**: Categorical Crossentropy (for one-hot encoded labels) or Sparse Categorical Crossentropy (for integer labels).
- **Batch Size**: Commonly set to 64.
- **Epochs**: The number of training epochs is set based on experimentation (e.g., 20 epochs).
- **Additional Techniques**: Data augmentation techniques might be applied to enhance model robustness, along with early stopping and learning rate scheduling for improved convergence.

## üìà Results & Evaluation

Upon training, the CNN model is evaluated on the test set. The results section typically includes:

- **Accuracy Metrics**: Training accuracy, validation accuracy, and test accuracy.
- **Loss Curves**: Graphs showing the decline of training and validation loss over epochs.
- **Visualizations**: Example predictions, confusion matrix, and other performance visualizations to provide insight into the model‚Äôs strengths and weaknesses.

The evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of the CNN architecture in learning discriminative features from the CIFAR-10 dataset for object recognition and classification tasks.
